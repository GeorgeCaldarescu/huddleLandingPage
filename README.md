## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This was one of my first challenges after I learned HTML and CSS. Really useful to practice containers and design, for this challenge, I used flexbox.
